# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Routine Information

This app does not track or collect basic information about our
users such as IP addresses, browser details, or timestamps.  This extension is installed on your computer, so this tracking is unneccesary.


## Cookies

Where necessary, this app uses cookies to 
store information about a visitorâ€™s preferences and history 
in order to better serve the user and/or 
present the user with customized content.

This includes storing your most recent color selection, the
last view tabbed, and using localStorage for any custom
color palettes and other data files uploaded by the user.

Because of the nature of Chrome extensions being installed
on your computer directly, no server is involved, so the
developer has no access to this information.


## Links to Third Party Websites

We have included links on this app for your use and reference.
We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these 
websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies 
of these websites may differ from our own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to 
us, but remember that no method of transmission over the 
Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. 
While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to 
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee 
its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy PolicyThis Privacy Policy is effective as of [[Date]] and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.
We reserve the right to update or change our 
Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this 
Privacy Policy periodically. If we make any material 
changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you 
by placing a prominent notice on our github repository.
