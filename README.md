The color kit is a Google Chrome Extension for both choosing colors 
and performing conversions between RGB, HSV, and Hex directly in the browser.
A variety of tools are available within the extension:

* Choosing colors from RGB and HSV sliders
* 2D gradients against a third value (e.g. Sat/Val over Hue) similar to Photoshop and other apps
* Named list of color palettes such as Web Safe and Pantone colors
* Choosing colors from uploaded images
* Eyedropper tool for grabing colors from webpages (coming soon)
* User ability to upload files to provide their own color palettes
* Output as hex color (and other CSS color types coming soon)

### Future Features

These features are planned to be released soon:

* Eyedropper tool for web pages
* Automatic detection of colors used on web pages into a list
* Drag-select multiple colors from a photo
* Organizing custom palette sets
* Import/export internal file system for backups and sharing custom color sets with friends
* CSS gradient generator (maybe?)
* Tools for picking complementary colors
